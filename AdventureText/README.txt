//Future Plans
//The audio has to be clicked because the built-in browser settings automatically turn it off.
//The game is not meant to be played on anything other than the full screen. I only added the media queries to have a functional preview on my portfolio.

- I want to enhance the decision-making feature
1. Tie it to the dialogue and change the game state/story progression.
2. effect the ending
3. find different items/characters

-The Character Background
1. Add info about the characters you meet and change as you learn more about them

-Add a fighting mechanic
1. texted based and turn-based fighting involving enemies and your party
2. health and sanity system. 


-Fix Some HTML and CSS to make the structure better(resizing browser) 

I plan on working on this over time, so everything is a work in progress/subject to change.

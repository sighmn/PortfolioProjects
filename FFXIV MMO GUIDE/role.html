  <h2>The Tank role!</h2>
  <p>WAR is only one of the four tanks in FFXIV. The tank role has universal rules to follow, and it's best to understand these fundamental rules before you start playing. </p>
    
<section>
  <h3>1.) Tank Role Abilities</h3>
  <p>First, let's discuss the role abilities. Role abilities are universal, meaning every tank has them. Often, novice players fail to pay more attention to these abilities, which can harm their performance as a tank.</p> 
<p>Remember, providing a more effortless experience for your DPS and healers is your job. Grouping mobs and maintaining aggro is critical, but knowing the nuances makes you a cut above the rest.</p> 
<p> Below is a table for all role abilites!</p>

    <h3>2.) Rules/Nuances</h3>
    <h4>1. Gap closing</h4>
    <p>In a dungeon, you may be tempted to gap close to the nearest enemy for better control over grouping enemies. Yes, DPS can often damage the enemies before you can establish enmity, or you may want to clear faster. Whatever your reason, it is a good idea to gauge your healer's capabilities beforehand or ask them if it's ok. You and your healer are a team; you're not a solo entity; without your healer, you will die(unless you're a WAR, but we will get into that in a moment).</p>
    <p>Warrior is the exception at 82-100. The reason for this is because of bloodwhetting. Warriors can sustain themselves independently for the entire dungeon. You may be asking, is this fair? The answer is no, it's not, but it's in the game now, so utilize it as much as you can.</p>
    <h4>2. AOE or Single Attack</h4>
    <p>When pulling mobs in a dungeon, it is a good rule of thumb to use only AOE attacks until two enemies are left. During a boss battle, however, you should only use single-target attacks. </p>

  <h2 class="center">FAQ</h2>
    
  <h3>What is the best tank?</h3>
  <p>Well, there is no "best tank", but a good starter tank is the warrior! Each tank has its own unique charm and should be considered.</p>

  <h3>Why do people call WAR a healer?</h3>
  <p>Warrior has an ability called bloodwhetting, and it is potent. The ability allows you to heal while doing damage, which, combined with your AOE abilities, gives you basically no damage taken for 8 seconds.</p>

  <h3>What is the most complex tank?</h3>
  <p>All the tanks are straightforward in how they are played. They just take a combination of reading the tool-tips and practice!</p>
